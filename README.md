# RF-Based-Indoor-Localization
## About

This project aims to create an Indoor RF based Localization System. Localization, in its simplest form, is defined as the process of predicting location of people, devices and other objects of interest We plan to develop an app that can detect in real time where a person is located and point this information on Map. In the first phase, we plan to create a 2D Map of the CSIS Department building and deploy our application there. 

## Key Topics

 - Systems & Networks
 - Android App Development
 - Machine Learning

## Prerequisites
We don't expect students to have in depth knowledge on any of the above topics. However having a basic understanding of Networks, App Development and Machine Learning would certainly help.
